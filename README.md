## Passwords — Scores & Feedback

### 1) `JwK;j2m;as` — **17 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 6 + Variety 8 + Unpredictability 3 = **17**  
- **Feedback:** Solid. Good mix of character types. The repeated `;` slightly lowers unpredictability. Add digits or extend to 12+ for top-tier strength.

---

### 2) `$VN3]+LsE0nz` — **19 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 7 + Variety 8 + Unpredictability 4 = **19**  
- **Feedback:** Very strong and random. Length is good but just shy of perfect. A few more characters would max it out.

---

### 3) `LnSovQOXHu` — **13 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 6 + Variety 4 + Unpredictability 3 = **13**  
- **Feedback:** Letters only. Adding digits and symbols, or extending length, would strengthen it considerably.

---

### 4) `hJFZDOXDWKxyDNFS` — **15 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 8 + Variety 4 + Unpredictability 3 = **15**  
- **Feedback:** Strong length (16 chars), but mostly uppercase. Lacks digits and symbols. Adding both would raise entropy.

---

### 5) `i^Ga>eXwmOVE` — **17 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 7 + Variety 6 + Unpredictability 4 = **17**  
- **Feedback:** Random and strong mix of characters. Only missing digits. Add one and extend length for better resilience.

---

### 6) `qEIKHPRbSt` — **13 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 6 + Variety 4 + Unpredictability 3 = **13**  
- **Feedback:** Shortish and only letters. Could resemble an acronym, which makes it guessable. Add variety and length.

---

### 7) `LqwDCXQg` — **11 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 5 + Variety 4 + Unpredictability 2 = **11**  
- **Feedback:** Too short and letter-only. Only suitable for disposable or trivial accounts.

---

### 8) `{<y)W62v0m/z%|` — **19 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 7 + Variety 8 + Unpredictability 4 = **19**  
- **Feedback:** Excellent mix of all character types. Strong and random, though tough to memorize (good use-case for a manager).

---

### 9) `zebJSFyDHK` — **13 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 6 + Variety 4 + Unpredictability 3 = **13**  
- **Feedback:** Semi-random but limited to letters. Needs digits and symbols.

---

### 10) `/+S&G2&k` — **15 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 5 + Variety 8 + Unpredictability 2 = **15**  
- **Feedback:** Great variety in a short space. Main weakness is length. Extend to ≥12 for much stronger protection.

---

### 11) `vOqT:FY!Xy;i` — **17 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 7 + Variety 6 + Unpredictability 4 = **17**  
- **Feedback:** Nice mix, looks random. No digits. Add one or two to push it further.

---

### 12) `CIRWCdvL` — **11 / 20**
- **Breakdown:** Length 5 + Variety 4 + Unpredictability 2 = **11**  
- **Feedback:** Short, mostly uppercase with predictable structure. Not recommended for secure use.

## Quick Actionable Tips

- **Length > 12** is the single biggest boost.
- **Use all 4 types**: lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols.
- **Skip short letter-only passwords** — they are trivial to crack.
- **Never reuse** passwords. One breach = all accounts exposed.
- **Use a password manager** to handle unique, complex strings for every site.
- **Consider passphrases** (multiple random words + symbol + digit) for memorability.

---

## Best Practices

- **Length:** 14+ for normal, 16+ for financial/admin accounts.  
- **Variety:** Mix all character classes.  
- **Randomness:** Avoid patterns or “leet” substitutions.  
- **Uniqueness:** Every site gets its own password.  
- **Extra protection:** Always enable 2FA (TOTP or hardware keys over SMS).  
- **Rotation:** Only change after a breach — not routinely.  
- **Storage:** Only in a reputable password manager, never plaintext.  
- **Passphrases:** Combine random words for a balance of security and usability.

---

## Common Attack Methods

- **Brute force:** Every possible combo. Counter with length and variety.  
- **Dictionary attacks:** Real words and common substitutions. Avoid simple words.  
- **Credential stuffing:** One site leaks, attackers try it everywhere. Avoid reuse.  
- **Rainbow tables:** Precomputed hashes. Salted storage mitigates this.  
- **Phishing:** Fake login pages. Complexity won’t help if you hand it over.  
- **Malware / keyloggers:** Captures keystrokes. Protect endpoints and use 2FA.  
- **Social engineering:** Public info (pets, dates). Don’t base passwords on personal details.

## Why Complexity Helps (Straight Talk)

Passwords are a math problem — the more complex and longer you make them, the harder and slower it is for attackers. A short, predictable password gets cracked instantly by automated tools. A long, random one multiplies the effort dramatically.

But be practical: you don’t need to memorize 20-character gibberish for every site. Offload that to a password manager and enable 2FA. That combination already handles 90% of real-world threats. Complexity keeps out casual attacks and raises the bar for serious ones. Add 2FA, and you massively reduce your risk.
